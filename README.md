# matching-game
This repository contains a simple matching game I designed in 2017 using C# and Visual Studio.

In order to open the application, go to matching-game/MatchingGame/bin/Debug/MatchingGame.exe

Note: Since it was implemented in Visual Studio, the application will only work on Windows machines. If you have a Mac or Linux-based system, you will have to use a virtual machine to access it.
